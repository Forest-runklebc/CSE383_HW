		XML is often criticised for being too verbose and making file length too long.
		With every element needing an opening and closing tag as well as possible name
		spacing to avoid tag-naming collisions, files can get very difficult to read
		as well as very long. Elements can even have attributes which further describe
		an element. These are not to be confused with subelements. The difference is 
		unclear and may be confusing at times.
		XML was created to be easy to work with, not to be efficient of concise.
		(For example - This small xml HW document is already getting a little long.)
